# Zomato Global Data Analysis
This repository contains code and analysis for exploring and visualizing Zomato's global restaurant data. The data contains information on restaurants from various cities around the world, including restaurant names, locations, cuisines, ratings, and pricing.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data). It contains over 22,000 restaurant records from multiple countries.

# Code
The code for this analysis is written in Python and uses several popular libraries, including pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The code is divided into several Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a different aspect of the analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

# Analysis
The analysis begins with data cleaning and preparation, which involves removing duplicates, handling missing values, and creating new features from existing ones. The exploratory data analysis then follows, where we look at the distribution of various features, the correlation between different variables, and the most popular cuisines, restaurants, and locations.
Finally, we use data visualization to showcase our findings and insights from the analysis, including maps, bar charts, and scatterplots. We also provide recommendations for restaurants to visit in different cities based on ratings, cuisine, and price.

# Conclusion
Through this analysis, we have gained valuable insights into the global restaurant industry and how it varies by location and cuisine. We hope that this analysis will be useful to anyone interested in exploring restaurant data or looking for recommendations on where to eat around the world.
